<p><big><font face="Bookman Old Style"><b>GRE : Graduate Record Examination</b></font></big></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is developed and
administered by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). The GRE measures your ability to
handle graduate-school level work through verbal, quantitative, and analytical reasoning
questions. Graduate school admissions committees use your score to gauge your abilities
and compare it with those of other applicants. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The GRE is now a computer adaptive test (CAT). In other
words, no more pencils, ovals, or erasure dust. Instead, you will take the exam on a
computer. During the test, you will see one question at a time, which you must answer in
order to move on to the next question. The first question will be of average difficulty.
The computer will then select subsequent questions based on whether you got the first one
right or wrong. The exam will continue in this way until you've seen the required mix of
concepts and question types. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On the GRE, you will receive a &quot;scaled score&quot;
within a range of 200-800 for each of the three sections (verbal, quantitative, and
analytical). You can score no higher than 800 or lower than 200 on any one section. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">GRE Subject Tests<br>
Another exam you might have to take is a GRE Subject Test. These exams are designed to
test your knowledg of a particular subject area, such as English, chemistry, or sociology.
In all, there are sixteen tests covering a variety of topics. However, not every graduate
school or program requires a subject test. Check the admissions requirements of the
schools you're considering. </font></p>

<p><a name="testdates"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Test Dates and Registration </font></b></a></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You are allowed to take the GRE once per calendar month,
and since you can only schedule your GRE a few days ahead, register early for an assured
date and location. CAT dates are subject to change without notice; so be sure to verify
precise dates during registration. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Start by getting a copy of the GRE Registration Bulletin,
containing information on scheduling, pricing, repeat testing, cancellation policies, and
more. You can receive a GRE Registration Bulletin by calling ETS at 609-771-7670;
downloading it from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gre.org/">http://www.gre.org/</a>
; or visiting your local Kaplan center. </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Description of the General Test</h3>

<p>The General Test measures verbal, quantitative, and analytical skills that have been
acquired over a long period of time and that are not related to any specific field of
study. The test consists of three scored sections.</p>

<p><b>Verbal</b>: 30-minute section (30 questions) &#151; The verbal measure tests your
ability to analyze and evaluate written material and synthesize information obtained from
it, analyze relationships among component parts of sentences, and recognize relationships
between words and concepts. Because students have wide-ranging backgrounds, interests, and
skills, the verbal sections of the General Test use questions from diverse areas of
experience. The areas tested range from the activities of daily life to broad categories
of academic interest such as the sciences, social studies, and the humanities.</p>

<p><b>Quantitative</b>: 45-minute section (28 questions) &#151; The quantitative measure
tests your basic mathematical skills and your understanding of elementary mathematical
concepts, as well as your ability to reason quantitatively and solve problems in a
quantitative setting. The content areas included in the quantitative sections of the test
are arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and data analysis. These are content areas usually
studied in high school. </p>

<p><b>Analytical</b>: 60-minute section (35 questions) &#151; The analytical measure tests
your ability to understand structured sets of relationships, deduce new information from
sets of relationships, analyze and evaluate arguments, identify central issues and
hypotheses, draw sound inferences, and identify plausible causal explanations. Questions
in the analytical section measure reasoning skills developed in virtually all fields of
study. No formal training in logic or methods of analysis is needed to do well in these
sections.<br>
</p>

<p align="left"><b>Modified Versions of Questions</b></p>

<p>The test you take may include questions that are modified versions of published
questions or of questions you have already seen on an earlier section of the test. Some
modifications are substantial; others are less apparent. Thus, even if a question appears
to be similar to a question you have already seen, it may in fact be a different question
and may also have a different correct answer. You can be assured of doing your best on the
test you take by paying careful attention to the wording of each question as it appears in
your test.</p>

<p>The GRE Program is currently investigating the feasibility of reusing questions that
have been published in GRE practice materials. As part of that investigation, you may see
questions from these materials on a test you take.<a name="howwork"></a></p>

<h3 align="center">How Does the Computer-Based General Test Work?</h3>

<p>At the start of the test, you are presented with test questions of middle difficulty.
As you answer each question, the computer scores that question and uses that information,
as well as your responses to any preceding questions and information about the test
design, to determine which question is presented next. As long as you respond correctly to
each question, questions of increased difficulty typically will be presented. When you
respond incorrectly, the computer typically will present you with questions of lesser
difficulty. Your next question will be the one that best reflects both your previous
performance and the requirements of the test design. This means that different test takers
will be given different questions.</p>

<p>Because the computer scores each question before selecting the next one, you must
answer each question when it is presented. For this reason, once you answer a question and
move on to another, you cannot go back and change your answer. The computer has already
incorporated both your answer and requirements of the test design into its selection of
the next question for you.</p>

<p>Each computer-based test section meets preestablished specifications, including the
types of questions asked and the subject matter presented. The statistical characteristics
of the questions answered correctly and incorrectly, including the difficulty levels, are
taken into account in the calculation of the score. Therefore, it is appropriate to
compare scores of different test takers even though they received different questions.</p>

<p>ETS has conducted research studies indicating that computer-based General Test Scores
are comparable to scores earned on the paper-based General Test.</p>

<p>There are two ways you can register for a General Test. </p>

<p><b>What to take to the test center:</b> 

<ul>
  <li>your authorization voucher (if you requested and received one from ETS) </li>
  <li>acceptable <a href="http://www.gre.org/idreq.html">identification</a> </li>
  <li>the names of the schools and/or institutions where you would like to send your scores.

</ul>

<h3 align="center">Reporting Your Scores</h3>

<p>If you choose to view your scores after completing the test, you may request that they
be sent to as many as 4 graduate institutions or fellowship sponsors at no additional
charge. An official paper score report will be mailed from ETS to you and to your score
recipients 10-15 days following the test. Iinstitutions also have the option of receiving
scores in alternate formats which are sent out approximately twice a month. They may also
receive scores via the Internet, which is updated twice a week.</p>

<p>If an institution is not listed, ask the test center administrator for the appropriate
form to indicate unlisted institutions. Complete the form and turn it in <b>before </b>you
leave the test center. The form will not be accepted after you leave the test center. If
you do not select institutions on the test day, you will be required to pay US$13 per
recipient to have the scores sent at a later date.</p>
