<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Interview Practice</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Practicing for the interview means practicing several
behaviors - not just answering questions. You must dress well, watch your body language
and posture, practice your manners and eye contact as well as practice answering questions
correctly, smoothly, and with confidence. The practice questions below, in one form or
another, account for a large percentage of interview questions. With each question, you
are given a series of choices as to how you might answer the question. When you select an
answer, you will learn whether your answer is correct-and why. Answering these questions
will help you polish your interviewing techniques. The questions and answers in this
excercise are generic and, in many cases, must be tailored to your individual situation.
Still, the logic behind the answer remains essentially the same.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Prepare</b>Do not go in attempting to &quot;wing&quot; it.
Keep in mind there are lots of competitors for the job, and you will only have this
opportunity to impress the hiring authority. Research and know the company, their history,
products, services and reputation.</font> </p>
