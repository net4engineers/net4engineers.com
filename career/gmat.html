<p><font face="Verdana"><small>The <strong>Graduate Management Admission Test<sup>®</sup></strong>
(GMAT<sup>®</sup>) was designed to help business schools assess the qualifications of
applicants for advanced study in business and management. It measures basic verbal,
quantitative, and writing skills that are developed over a long period of time and is
available year-round at test centers throughout the world. Of the several thousand
graduate management programs worldwide, nearly 1,700 use the GMAT and more than 1,000
require it. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><small>In the school selection process, applicants are asked to
show evidence of their potential to succeed. The GMAT is only one such measure of
potential academic performance in graduate management education. In addition to the GMAT,
this evidence typically includes academic records, work experience, application essays,
recommendations, and interviews. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><small>The GMAT is specifically designed to measure the verbal,
quantitative, and writing skills of applicants for graduate study in business. It does
not, however, presuppose any specific knowledge of business or other specific content
areas, nor does it measure achievement in any particular subject areas. In addition, the
test does not measure subjective factors important to academic and career success such as
motivation, creativity, interpersonal skills, and study skills. Test takers should note
that the GMAT is entirely in English and that all instructions are provided in English.</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><small>All of the information that you need to prepare yourself
for taking GMAT, including the actual directions on the test, sample questions, and
testing procedures, is contained in subsequent sections of this web site. </small></font></p>

</strong><br>
The Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) measures general, verbal, mathematical, and
analytical writing skills. Most management institutes use the GMAT score as an indicator
of the student's ability to successfully undertake graduate level management programmes. <br>
<br>
<strong>The GMAT Computer-Adaptive Test (CAT) </strong><br>
<br>
In CAT, the computer screen displays one question at a time, chosen from a very large pool
of questions organised by their content and level of difficulty. </font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana">The first question in a computer-adaptive
test is always of medium difficulty. The questions that follow are determined by your
responses to all previous questions. <br>
<br>
CAT adjusts to your ability level - you&#146;ll get few questions that are either too easy
or too difficult. You must enter an answer for each question, and you may not return to or
change your response to any previously answered question. If you guess or answer a
question incorrectly by mistake, your answers to the questions that follow will lead you
back to the questions that are the appropriate level of difficulty for you. <br>

  <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
  800score.com method is to focus on these skills that are necessary for the GMAT and for
  success in business school.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for endurance, the first skill, you'll
  have to stare at a screen intensely and focus for nearly <i>four hours</i>. Keep this in
  mind when taking practice tests. Get used to working for many hours on end. Learn how to
  relax. The physical and mental exhaustion is part of the test's challenge.&nbsp; You
  should take as many practice CATs as possible to learn the test <i>and</i> to get used to
  the grueling experience.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second skill, a basic knowledge of grammar,
  math, reasoning, and argument formation, is covered in the later chapters of this online
  prep guide. No calculators are allowed on test day, so you need to practice doing
  basic&nbsp;math calculations.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third skill, test-taking skills, is covered
  in this chapter and throughout the online guide. Timing is a major part of test taking
  skill, particularly for the GMAT CAT. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve your problem-solving abilities, the
  fourth skill, we have extensive information on reasoning techniques and math concepts
  throughout this online guide. When you get a question wrong, make sure to review our
  explanations so that you understand the conceptual error that you made in the question.
  You do not want to repeat the error again. <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those six-figure starting salaries have had an impact on the
  MBA market... everyone wants one. In the early-'90's the average GMAT score of accepted
  students at New York University (Stern) Business School was 610. By 2000 it had jumped 76
  points to <b>686</b>. Getting a high score on the GMAT is crucial because the business
  schools are getting flooded with applicants. Applications to business schools will
  increase through 2001 and 2002 because many young technology workers want to escape the
  dotcom collapse and the impact of 9/11. Expect around a 690 average for the top-ten
  business schools in 2001-2002. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That 690 figure is deceptive because that average includes
  many students who were accepted for favorable traits (diversity, unusual accomplishment or
  success... etc.) that allow them to gain acceptance with a lower score. If you have none
  of these types of traits, you probably need to break 720 (<i>that's over the 99th
  percentile</i>) to have a good chance at a top ten school.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for the MBA bull market is that B-school grads are a
  hot commodity in a global market where the rules of business are in flux and employees
  with up-to-date knowledge are needed. Even though the tech sector may be down and some
  sectors may be experiencing weakness post 9/11, the underlying economy requires large
  numbers of MBAs. The point is that even if you don't get into <a
  href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/mba/">Wharton</a>, the MBA market is still strong
  enough that grads from second-and third-tier schools are doing well. Even if your starting
  position may not be what you had dreamed of pre-9/11, there is still plenty of
  opportunity.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1" color="#000000" face="Verdana">How the New GMAT CAT Works</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GMAT
  is now only available as a computerized test. This is how it works. Instead of having a
  pre-determined mixture of easy, medium, and hard questions, the computer will select
  questions for you based on how well you are doing. The first question will be of medium
  difficulty; if you get it right, the second question will be selected from a large group
  of questions that are a little harder. If you get the first question wrong, the second
  will be a little easier. The result is that the test automatically adjusts to your skill
  level.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font size="-2" face="Verdana" color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">Harder Questions Count More</font><font size="-2"
  face="Verdana" color="#000000"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A result of the CAT format is that the harder problems
  count more than easier ones. If one student does twenty <b>easy</b> questions, half of
  which he gets right and half of which he gets wrong, and then another student does twenty <b>very
  difficult</b> questions, half of which he gets right and half of which he gets wrong, the
  second student will get a higher score.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
  student who answered ten out of twenty very difficult questions incorrectly would still
  get a very high score on the GMAT CAT because the harder questions are more heavily
  weighted. Simpler questions might be easier to answer, but they count much less. Your goal
  should be to get as many hard questions right because that will get you your highest
  possible score.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana"><br>
  </font><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">Start Off Strong<br>
  </font><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CAT puts much more value on the earlier questions than
  the later questions. The computer has to make large jumps in the estimation of your score
  for each of the first few questions. The later questions are used to fine-tune your score.
  To get the best possible score, focus more time on the earlier questions than the later
  questions.</font><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">.<br>
  </font><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana"><br>
  A skilled GMAT test-taker focuses his efforts on getting the early, hard questions
  correct. Therefore, as we'll see in the next section, the optimal strategy for the CAT is
  to go extremely slowly and carefully at the beginning of the test.<br>
  </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1" color="#000000" face="Verdana">GMAT Pacing Strategies for the CAT</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font
  color="#000000" face="Verdana">One Mean CAT</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To quote
  ETS, the makers of the GMAT, &quot;<b>Time management is key.</b>&quot; Your timing skills
  could add or subtract 100 points from your score. Timing skills are important because the
  CAT has unusual pacing constraints:<br>
  </font><ul>
    <li><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">DOUBLE PENALTY- for any unfinished
      questions at the end of each section when time expires. The penalty for unfinished
      questions is severe (worse than getting a question wrong). You should pace yourself to
      make sure that you finish all the questions in the allotted time. <br>
      .</font><font color="#000000" face="Verdana"> </font></li>
    <li><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">NO DOUBLE CHECKING- All answers are
      final. If you finish a section early, you cannot go back to double check your earlier
      answers. For example, if you hurry and finish your section with 20 minutes left, you are
      stuck at the end of the test with 20 extra minutes. <br>
      .</font><font color="#000000" face="Verdana"> </font></li>
    <li><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">NO SKIPPING- When you hit a tough
      question or get a mental block, you cannot skip the question without entering an answer.
      Instead, you have to trudge through it, guess, and hope you don't waste too much time. <br>
      .</font><font color="#000000" face="Verdana"> </font></li>
    <li><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">GO FASTER AND FASTER- The value of each
      question decreases as the section progresses. The first few questions will determine most
      of your score, so you have to start slowly and carefully and then accelerate as the test
      progresses.</font><font color="#000000" face="Verdana"> </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana"><br>
  </font><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">Tame that CAT</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">...&nbsp;&nbsp;The proper pacing to the
  GMAT is difficult to learn. You have to accelerate as the test progresses, you have to
  finish the test on time, and you can't get bogged down on questions.</font><font
  color="#000000" face="Verdana"> </font><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">The
  CAT is engineered so that the early questions count much more than the later questions (we
  can't emphasize this enough). The result is that you should start off slowly to get the
  early questions right and then speed through the less important later questions. The last
  few questions are virtually valueless. The problem is that the natural human reaction is
  to go quickly at the beginning (when you are nervous) and miss the most valuable
  questions. </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">&nbsp;Lower scorers should spend more
  time on the important early questions to get at least a few of them right. Higher scorers
  should balance their time to get as many questions right as possible. Also, adjust
  yourself to spend slightly less time on the Sentence Corrections and Quantitative
  Comparison questions and more time on the Reading Comprehension questions.</font></p>

  </font><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">How to take control of your pacing<br>
  </font><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the above strategies (which are the
  standard approaches taught by GMAT prep companies) is that they are very hard to apply.
  For example, if you are on question 10 with 47 minutes left, are you on pace to finish the
  test? <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GMAT students complained that they had trouble
  learning the right pacing and that they wasted their practice tests trying to master the
  GMAT CAT's complicated pacing strategies.&nbsp;Faced with these complaints, we developed
  the <a href="http://www.800score.com/pacer.html#anchor36929">Test Pacer</a> patent-pending
  pace-training system and built it into our 5 GMAT CAT practice tests. The Pacer tells you
  what question you should be on so that you finish the test on time. Like a training wheel,
  the more you practice with the Pacer, the stronger your sense of timing will become.<br>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">The Art of Guessing</font><font color="#000000"
size="-1" face="Verdana"><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guessing, like pacing, is more important on the CAT than on any
other test you have ever taken. You'll have to guess often on the CAT because:</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">You can't skip questions. If you hit a
    mental block, you have to guess at the question in front of you. You can't pass over a
    question and go back to it later. Since all answers are final, you have to make sure your
    guess is a good one. Most students waste more than 1/3 of their time bogged down on a
    handful of tough questions. You have to learn how to guess, move on, and cut your losses
    after spending more than a few minutes on a question. <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">At the end of the test, when time is
    about to expire, you have to hurry to make sure to get to every question or else face the
    severe penalty for not finishing all the test's questions. Many students have to do this
    last minute sprint and are often left guessing on the last few questions.</font><font
    color="#000000" face="Verdana"> </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana"><br>
P.O.E</font><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana"><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key guessing strategy is <b>P.O.E</b> (process of
elimination). A big asset going into test day is knowing that one of the five possible
answers <i>must be right. </i>If you can eliminate two of the choices, you can increase
your chances of getting the right answer by 65% (from 20%- 1 in 5 to 33% -1 in 3). Here's
how to do it...<br>
</font>

<ol>
  <li><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">Eliminate answer choices you know are
    wrong. Even if you don't know the right answer, you can often tell that some of the answer
    choices are wrong. For example, on the Data Sufficiency questions you can eliminate at
    least two of the answer choices by determining if one of the statements is true. <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">Avoid answer choices that look
    suspicious. For example, on Sentence Correction questions, beware of any answer choices
    that look completely different from all of the other choices. In the Quantitative section,
    you can usually eliminate any answers that are negative when all the other answers are
    positive.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">Once you have narrowed down the list of
    answer choices, pick one of the remainder. It is a myth that some answer choices, like A
    or C, are more often correct than other choices.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">Draw a Grid<br>
</font><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If crossing off answer choices on paper tests helps to
clarify your thinking (using the P.O.E), you might want to consider making a grid on your
scratch paper. By drawing a simple grid and labeling the rows A through E, you can keep
track of which answers you have eliminated by putting an X in that box.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">The Importance of Scratch Paper</font><font
color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana"><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another big asset you have going into test day is virtually
unlimited scratch paper. Use it and make sure you have lots of it on test day (Note:
calculators are not allowed).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll need scratch paper because you are taking a test off of a
computer screen, <i>and you can't write on the screen</i>. The result is that you'll often
have to carefully copy much of the question down onto paper without miscopying the
information. This is awkward and difficult. It takes valuable time to recopy information
and it increases the chance of a hurried error, so you have to be careful about what you
copy and what you don't copy. Try to use scratch paper extensively on your practice tests
to get a feel for this. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</font><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">Experiments on CATs<br>
<br>
</font><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 1/3 of
the questions on the CAT are experimental and will be randomly mixed in with your normal
questions. In these questions you are being used as a guinea pig for experimentation to
assess the difficulty of the question. In the future, that question may be positioned at a
difficulty level depending on how students performed on it when it was an experimental
question.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequence of the experimental questions is that you
can't rely on all the questions being at your difficulty level. In other words, if you are
a high scorer you can't expect all the questions past question five to be difficult (at
your level). Try to avoid obsessing over how hard your questions are as a measure of your
performance.<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">Don't Panic</font><font color="#000000"
size="-1" face="Verdana"><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a bad day, you have the option of canceling.
When you finish the test, the computer will offer the option of canceling the test or
accepting it. If you cancel the test neither you nor any school will see your score. If
you accept the test, the computer will display your score and it will be available to all
schools (official scores will be mailed about two weeks later). Relax and make sure to
schedule the test far in advance of when it is due. Make sure you have adequate time to
cancel and reschedule the test if necessary.<br>
