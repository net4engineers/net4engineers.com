Net4Engineers.com was started by vjhawar and pankajbatra in their college dorm as a college startup out of their interest in web programming in 2001.
Those were days when java was hot and Servlet's was the new thing. We fell in love with java and serlvets which eventually enabled us to launch net4engineers.com.

This is how we really wrote code in college and build the site on dial up connections.
Over the next few years we went onto develop an online exam module - Examonline.
Launched the wap version of the website. Integrated with sms services to deliver matching jobs from job portals to engineering students.

While the code would be too amateur for us today to refer, but some of the creatives and layouts we created still stand out spick and span till date.
If you are looking for simple online testing software you could still fork out Examonline - https://github.com/pankajbatra/ExamOnline.
