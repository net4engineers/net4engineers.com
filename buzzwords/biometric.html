&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
the movie Mission Impossible I, only one authorized person can access a high-security
computer room. His retina is scanned and only when it matches, is he allowed admission
into the room. This is biometrics being used for verification in movies. Biometric
technologies are used to accurately identify and verify an individual&#146;s identity.
This involves identifying his physiological and behavioral characteristics. Biometrics, in
general, refers to the study of biological characteristics. With reference to computer
security, it refers to authentication techniques using biological characteristics that are
measurable or identifiable, and unique to an individual.Biometric systems are not
flawless. Just as any new technology, biometrics, too, has drawbacks. Some biometric
systems are easy to fool, while some are just not feasible to implement, because of their
exorbitant installation and maintenance costs and resource requirements.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The accuracy of any biometric system is
measured in two ways: FAR (False Acceptance Rate), where an impostor is accepted as a
match, and FRR (False Rejection Rate), where a legitimate match is denied access. For a
system to be successful, both have to be within acceptable low limits.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fingerprint verification involves the user
placing his finger over a glass-plate which resides over a high-resolution CCD
(charge-coupled) camera. The image captured is compared to that in the system&#146;s
database. Positive identification or rejection, as the case may be, is based on the number
of minutiae (small lines on the surface of the skin) that match. The number that must
match for the result to be a &#145;hit&#146; or &#145;no hit&#146; can be defined. These
images are relatively large in size and so there can be many permutations and combinations
to adjust the threshold value. This technology is neither too expensive, nor does it
require extensive user-training. It&#146;s also simple to implement since a
fingerprint-reader can sit on a mouse or keyboard, or simply connect like one. It also
gives a high level of accuracy.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hand-geometry involves comparing a 3-D image
of the user&#146;s hand to that present in the system&#146;s database. This is fairly
complex in usage and thus calls for greater discipline from the user&#146;s side. Accuracy
is as good as, if not better, than fingerprint verification. Implementation is, however,
expensive since it involves high-resolution 3-D imaging.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Signature dynamics involves breaking-down of
the way a signature is made. Some qualities looked into include acceleration rates,
directions, pressure, and stroke length. A flaw with this technology lies in the
randomness or the inconsistency with which a user makes his signature. Due to this,
multiple matches might result in a higher number of FARs or FRRs. Accuracy is thus below
satisfactory levels and so can currently only be implemented in areas where precision is
not the only relevant factor in decision-making.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Voice dynamics relies on a voice
&#145;template&#146; created by the user during a training phase before first usage. He is
asked to repeat several phrases so that the system can create a unique &#145;image&#146;
of the person&#146;s voice patterns. However, this technique is prone to inaccuracy since
it relies on the behavior of the subject rather than the physical characteristics of the
voice. Incon- sistent repetition of phrases can lead to incorrect results. It&#146;s
inaccuracy overshadows the inexpensive equipment required to implement it.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Retinal scan is currently the most
dependable because of its high level of accuracy. It involves imaging of the blood vessels
in the retina of the eye when infra-red light of a certain frequency and wavelength is
incident upon it. The extent to which this energy is absorbed by the blood vessels is
different in different individuals. However, this method of imaging is personally invasive
since it involves the projection of a laser-beam through the cornea of the eye. Also,
diseases like cataracts or infections affect the evaluation by the system and could return
inconsistent results. Extreme skill and discipline (not to forget patience) is required on
both the operator&#146;s and the end user&#146;s side.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Iris scan uses a concept similar to retinal
scanning, but uses a conventional CCD camera instead of infra-red radiation. The subject
is made to stand 12 to 14&#148; from a camera, which frame-grabs an image of the iris.
Since this is a very high-resolution image, the accuracy of this technology is the highest
after the retinal scan system. This is, however, in the prototype testing stage and so it
will be a while before it is commercially available.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DNA analysis, which involves checking the
DNA patterns of a human, is used when the physical characteristics are unrecognizable,
especially to identify dead people. It is also used to find out relationships, like in
cases involving identifying a child&#146;s natural parents. This is one biometric
technology that is judicially accepted. Since no humans have identical DNA patterns (with
the rare exception of twins), this is one of the most foolproof methods of all.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Modern technology allows the system to scan
the DNA directly by taking dead cells from a person&#146;s external skin.&nbsp;<br>
Other biometric technologies include face-recognition systems and vascular-pattern
recognition systems. Both of these, however, are in their initial development stages and
so cannot be compared to the other biometric systems already available.</font></p>
