hackers to view films online</font></font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Downloading MP3s from the Net&#151;whether
it be music-swapping through Napster or just visiting sites to search for the music you
want&#151;has today become second nature to most computer users. The prime reason behind
this popularity is the fact that MP3s are small files, easy to download and store on your
hard disk or burn on a CD, and give near CD-quality music. Now, the video front also seems
to be poised for the same scenario.Distributing good-quality digital video over the Net
has been a very cumbersome task, because videos are huge files that take a long time to
download and are difficult to store on your hard disk. Moreover, the quality of the
downloaded file makes the whole process a task that&#146;s better left undone. However,
the spread</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">of broadband (which translates to much
higher bandwidths) coupled with two &#145;hacker&#146; utilities, DeCSS and DivX, have
opened the doors to online distribution of good-quality digital video. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">DeCSS is a small utility that breaks the encryption scheme
of DVDs and allows you to copy the contents onto your hard disk so that you can view it on
your PC. DeCSS was initially developed to allow Linux users to watch DVDs on their PCs,
because there were no DVD players for the Linux operating system. Unencrypted DVD content
got through DeCSS is, however, difficult to share online because of its huge size, which
is between 4&#150;9 GB. This is where DivX&#151;usually written as DivX;-)&#151;plays a
crucial role.DivX allows a 90-minute DVD movie to be compressed to about one-tenth or less
of its original size, thereby making it small enough to download from the Net and even
burn on a regular 650 MB CD, without much loss in quality. With DivX, it&#146;s possible
to download a two-hour movie in 45 minutes to two hours, depending on your Net connection.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">The codec (compression-decompression) was
developed by a French video engineer and hacker, Jerome Rota, and has gained immense
popularity in the hacker world since its release last year. DivX uses MPEG-4 for video
encoding (hacked from a beta version of Windows Media Player) and is available for all
operating systems. You can download and play DivX encoded movies using Windows Media
Player.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2">Encoding a DVD movie is a long process that
can take up to 10 hours and requires lots of hard-disk space and processing power. You
need a variety of software including DivX for the task. The process begins with using
DeCSS or an application like SmartRipper to rip the files off the DVD and copy them to
your hard disk. These files have a VOB extension and can occupy up to 9 GB of hard disk
space. Then, you use an application like FlasK MPEG that uses the DivX codec to encode the
movie into a</font> <font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2">DivX data stream. To
handle the audio encoding, you need a codec like Radium MP3, an application to extract the
audio from the VOB file, another one to enhance its quality, and finally an encoder to
encode the file into MP3 or other audio formats. Then, you need to merge the audio with
the video. Software like VirtualDub lets you encode audio and merge the audio and video
simultaneously. It also gives you the option of encoding audio into MP3 or DivX audio. To
play the encoded file, you need the DivX codec to decode the movie (this happens
automatically), and Windows Media Player.</font></p>
