<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The human ability to look at a face, memorize it, and
recall it when you meet the same person again is entering the domain of the computer.
Called facial recognition, this technique enables the computer to use your face as your
password, or identify criminals by looking at photographs of a crowd and matching these to
an existing database.&nbsp;</font><!--webbot bot="ImageMap" startspan

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The advantages of face recognition over other biometric
techniques are that it&#146;s non-intrusive and less expensive to set up. The subject of
recognition needn&#146;t click on anything or give his fingerprint, for instance, his
photograph can be captured even without his knowledge. It&#146;s less expensive in the
sense that databases&#151;of employees, national citizens, criminals, etc&#151;may already
exist. The hardware required for a small home or office setup is also not very
expensive&#151;all you need are standard video cameras with a resolution of at least
320x240 and a frame rate of at least 3&#150;5 fps, a good video card, and a processor with
enough speed. After this, all you need to buy is the software.&nbsp;<br>
Like other biometric techniques, recognizing a face involves taking pictures of that face,
extracting its features, creating a template from these features, and comparing this to
existing templates in a database. Two techniques&#151;&#145;eigenfaces&#146; and
&#145;local feature analysis&#146;&#151;are primarily used for this.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" color="#808080" size="3"><u>Eigenfaces</u></font><font
face="Arial" size="2"><br>
</b>Also called PCA (Principle Component Analysis), this technology is patented at MIT,
and is being used by Viisage in its face-recognition software.Pictures of millions of
faces are used to build the eigenface database. These pictures are first compared to see
if any features are common between them, and are then used to build the database, which
comprises two-dimensional, grayscale, global (taking the face as a single entity) images,
each of which has different light and dark areas to highlight different characteristics of
a face. The premise is that any face can be built by combining 100&#150;125
eigenfaces.&nbsp;To begin facial recognition, a photograph of the subject is used to to
create a &#145;template&#146;, by encoding the face&#146;s characteristics into numbers.
This template is compared to the eigenfaces&#146; database, which throws up
results&#151;the faces which the template matches most closely.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The disadvantage of eigenfaces is that since it considers
global images, a change in facial expression of the subject&#151;smiling or frowning, or a
change in pose or lighting&#151;skews the results. LFA (local feature analysis) does away
with this weakness.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" color="#808080" size="3"><u>Local feature analysis</u></font><font
face="Arial" size="2"><br>
</b>Currently used by Visionics&#146; face-recognition software, FaceIt, LFA takes a
face&#146;s features to be its building blocks. It bases its results on individual
features and their relative distances from each other. So, if one feature changes, as in
the case of a smile, features around it will also change, and LFA will be able to consider
this change. FaceIt, for example, identifies 80 nodal points&#151;like the distance
between eyes, depth of eye sockets, cheekbones, jaw line or chin&#151;that define a face.
These nodal points are used to create a faceprint, a numerical code for that particular
face. Each faceprint is compressed to 84 bytes in size and stored. This is then compared
to faceprints stored in the existing database to come up with matching results.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Other techniques used for facial recognition include neural
networks and AFP (Automatic Face Processing) but these haven&#146;t been implemented
widely yet.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Face recognition can be used widely, from authenticating
people for access to computer networks, bank ATMs, etc, through smart cards, to searching
for terrorists or criminals in crowded places (FaceIt was recently used for this on
specatators at a football match in Tampa); for surveillance or on voters&#146; ID cards or
passports to prevent fraud. Taking this to the extreme, however, may soon lead to a day
when &#145;Big Brother is watching you&#146; becomes an everyday reality.</font></p>
