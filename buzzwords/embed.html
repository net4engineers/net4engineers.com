&quot;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soul of the modern appliances </strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#808080" size="3"><strong>Welcome to the age of
Electronic Pets</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Gone are the days when you had dumb stuffed toys with no
motion, or feelings to play with. Thanks to the wonders of modern electronics, toys are
getting a new life. They have been given feelings that get affected based on how you
behave with them. All the major toy makers across the world have been coming out with
advanced interactive toys that can become your friends for life. These toys are
electromechanical in nature, have sensors to listen, see, talk, and feel your touch. They
have complex circuitry, and some use micro-controller chips to control everything. They
have memory to store the code that drives the micro-controller, which in turn operates the
remaining parts. In other words, toys are amongst the most popular examples of embedded
systems. In this article, we&#146;ll see some of the most playful pets in the market, and
try to understand what makes them intelligent.&nbsp;The rapid development of intelligent
toys has been fueled by the fierce competition amongst leading toy manufacturers. Every
toy maker tries to introduce some hot selling toy to gain an edge over competition. So
we&#146;ve seen the intelligence level rising in the toys. One of the earliest instances
of &#145;intelligent&#146; toys was a pet teddy bear known as Teddy Ruxpin, introduced
sometime in the mid-80&#146;s. This little bear initially had an audio cassette player
built-in. When you played the recorder, Teddy Ruxpin moved its lips and blinked its eyes
to the sound of whatever was being played. The story telling teddy bear became an instant
hit with young children. Later, many variants to the toy were introduced. Another stuffed
toy was introduced that acted as Teddy Ruxpin&#146;s partner, and the two of them narrated
stories together. This however was not very intelligent. All it did was move its lips to
pre-recorded stories. Many other intelligent toys were introduced after this. Two of the
most prominent ones have been Furby from Tiger Electronics, and Sony&#146;s Aibo.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#808080" size="3"><u><b>The Furbies</b></u></font><font
face="Arial" size="2"><br>
Pet its back, and it may wag its little tail lovingly; Tickle its tummy to make it laugh
or pass a comment; Take it through different shades of light, and it thinks you want to
play hide-n-seek; Open its mouth, and it will ask to be fed. These are just some of the
things that a Furby is capable of doing. It&#146;s an interactive toy created by toy maker
Tiger Electronics, sometime in 1998.A Furby have no resemblance to any living creature.
It&#146;s a cute furry little creature that learns new &#147;tricks&#148; with time. They
have a distinct life cycle just like human beings, starting from being a baby Furby and
growing up to be an adult one. Furbys react differently to different situations.. The
first time you get a Furby, it speaks its own language called &#145;Furbish&#146;. As it
interacts with you over time, it starts using English more frequently. How much it can
communicate in English depends upon how you interact with it. Since no two human beings
are going to interact the same way with a furby, no two furbies will be alike. That&#146;s
the beauty of having this toy. It&#146;s almost as if it understands you.&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Furby&#146;s intelligence - </strong>Furby has a built in vocabulary of 160 words
that it combines to form about 1000 different phrases. That&#146;s why it can give a
different response each time. Furbies have five sensors in them. There&#146;s a sensor on
its back that understands petting. A sensor on the tummy senses tickles. A built-in
microphone triggers reactions related to sound and a light sensor detects changes in light
intensity (remember the hide-n-seek example mentioned above). Finally, the best part is an
IR port. This is used to communicate with other Furbies. So if you get a family of
Furbies, then they can interact with each other through IR. Not only that, but they
maintain decorum. If papa Furby talks, then baby Furby quietly listens. If one Furby
narrates a joke, the rest laugh at it. So you can imagine the number of permutations and
combinations that are possible with these sensors and the vocabulary. You can check out
more about Furby on their website <a href="http://www.furby.com">www.furby.com</a>.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#808080" size="3"><u><b>Aibo, the smart dog</b></u></font><font
face="Arial" size="2"><br>
If you thought that Furbies are amazing, then you&#146;ll get even more dazzled by Aibo,
the robotic dog created by Sony Corporation. The word Aibo has two meanings. The
&#145;Ai&#146; stands for Artificial Intelligence, and &#145;bo&#146; represents robot.
Aibo also translates to mean &#145;partner&#146; or &#145;pal&#146; in
Japanese.&nbsp;Aibo, just like the Furby has sensors to detect various emotions. It learns
and matures by interacting with people. It has a<img alt="aibo.jpg (13159 bytes)"
src="aibo.jpg" align="right" width="214" height="141"> state-of-the-art voice recognition
system that understands what you say. For instance, if you praise it for playing with a
ball, it will continue doing so. However, if you scold it, Aibo will not even look at the
ball. Aibo recognizes its name, so it will respond through electronic tones if you call
its names. Other than that, it can recognize and respond to about 50 words. It has six
emotions to display its happiness, anger, sadness, surprise, fear, and dislike. It has a
CCD camera and a distance sensor that allows it to avoid obstacles, and even recognize
colors it likes or dislikes. In fact, the camera can also be used to take pictures. It
recognizes the command &#147;take a picture&#148;. Of course, you need extra accessories
to be able to view those pictures on a computer screen. It has four sensors similar to
humans and animals, of touch, hear, see, and a sense of balance.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The robotic dog is amongst the most intelligent
implementations of an embedded system. It has 18 joints that can produce 250 different
types of movement. So it can run, dance, sit, and play with a ball. All actions of Aibo
are recorded on a 8 MB memory stick. There&#146;s even a development tool called Aibo
Master Studio that can be used to create original motion and sound data for Aibo.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><u><strong><font face="Arial" color="#808080" size="4">Remote Control your
Home</font></strong></u></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Home appliances, from refrigerators and
air-conditioners to televisions and microwave ovens, are going the embedded way. This
means that you&#146;ll soon be able to control the temperature of your air-conditioner
over the Internet, check e-mail on your refrigerator, make your microwave download recipes
from the Internet, or surf the Web on your television. Several home-appliance players have
already entered the embedded arena and more are expected to follow. Here&#146;s a look at
some products that have made an appearance.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">LG Electronics&#146; Digital DIOS refrigerator
can be used for surfing the Internet, checking e-mail, making video phone calls, and
watching TV. A link to an Internet company provides you with real-time grocery prices and
stocks available. It has a 15.1&#148; TFT-LCD touch screen and its own port to connect to
the Internet. You can use the LCD information window to find out more about what
you&#146;ve stored in the refrigerator: tips on food, nutrition and expiry dates of
products, recipes, nutrition information on the products inside and how to make them, as
well as the refrigerator&#146;s temperature. Samsung&#146;s digital network refrigerator
also lets you surf the Internet and check mail using a pop-up keyboard window, make video
or regular telephone calls, do instant messaging with your family members, and watch TV or
films on video tape or DVD. There&#146;s also a schedule manager to organize your
schedules and set alarms to remind you of important dates; a refrigerator manager to
control the temperature of the refrigerator, access a list of food kept inside, monitor
the water filter, etc; a digital album; and a cook helper that gives you menus and
recipes.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">LG&#146;s tables also contain a washing
machine and a microwave oven that are Internet-ready. The washing machine has a
communication cable that you can link to a PC with an Internet connection. You can then
connect to the washing machine&#146;s website, download washing programs suitable to the
different types of clothes you want to wash, and store them in the washing machine. A
terminal for home networking and a modem for the washing machine are under development.
These will allow you to download programs directly into the washing machine from the
Internet and to control the machine&#146;s operation from a remote location.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The microwave oven has a built-in modem that
it uses to access websites on cooking. It also goes a step ahead and automatically
downloads information like cooking time and microwave level for different recipes. So you
can put your dish in the microwave and let it figure out how to cook it. You can also add
your own information and bookmark your favorite food sites. The company also plans to add
links to grocery sites, so you can order groceries right from your microwave.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Coming out of the kitchen, IBM and Carrier are
working on developing air-conditioners that you can control over the Internet. A service
called Myappliance.com will let you control the temperature of your Carrier
Internet-enabled air-conditioner and switch it on and off through the website. You&#146;ll
also be able to use the website to transmit fault codes and diagnostic alerts to mobile
phones, e-mail addresses or fax machines of Carrier dealers.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the same vein, BPL has a television that
doubles up as a PC. So, apart from watching plain old vanilla TV, you can use the PC for
standard uses like word processing and surfing the Internet. The PC has a P/200 MHz MMX
processor, 16 MB RAM, 1.2 GB hard disk, an infrared keyboard, and a built-in modem and DVD
ROM that lets you watch movies or play audio CDs.</font>&nbsp;</p>
