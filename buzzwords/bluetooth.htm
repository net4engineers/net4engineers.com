7.5pt;font-family:Verdana">Bluetooth is a
    universal radio interface in the 2.45GHz ISM frequency band to function on a worldwide
    basis. The interface consists of hardware using ICs, a radio frequency chip, and a
    baseband chip. These parts work together to put a radio signal into the air that can
    communicate to another chipset imbedded in other product. This makes it easier to do
    everything, from networking different types of computers to transferring data between
    digital telephones.<br>
    Bluetooth can transmit through solid, non-metal objects. Its nominal link range is from 10
    cm to 10 m, which can be extended to 100 m by increasing the transmit power. Designed to
    operate in a noisy radio frequency environment, the Bluetooth radio uses a fast
    acknowledgement and frequency hopping scheme to make the link robust. Bluetooth radio
    modules avoid interference from other signals by hopping to a new frequency after
    transmitting or receiving packet.<br>
    Short range and fast hopping limit the impact of domestic and professional microwave
    ovens. Use of forward error correction (FEC) limits the impact of random noise on
    long-distance links. The encoding is optimized for an uncoordinated environment.<br>
    The Bluetooth baseband protocol is a combination of circuit and packet switching. Slots
    can be reserved for synchronous packets. Each packet is transmitted in a different hop
    frequency. A packet nominally covers a single slot, but can be extended to cover up to
    five slots.<br>
    The technology supports both isochronous and asynchronous services; easy integration of
    TCP/IP for networking. It can support an asynchronous data channel, up to three
    simultaneous synchronous voice channels, or a channel, which simultaneously supports
    asynchronous data and synchronous voice. Each voice channel supports 64kbps synchronous
    (voice) link. The asynchronous channel can support an asymmetric link of maximally 721
    kbps in either direction, while permitting 57.6 kbps in the return direction, or a
    432.6kbps symmetric link. </span><span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

7.5pt;font-family:Verdana">A Bluetooth system
    comprises a radio unit, a link controller, link manager, and software. <br>
    The Bluetooth radio interface is based on a nominal antenna power of 0 dBm. The air
    interface complies with the FCC rules for the ISM band at power levels up to 0 dBm.
    Spectrum spreading facilitates optional operation at power levels up to 100 mW worldwide.
    It is accomplished by frequency hopping in 79 hops displaced by 1 MHz, starting at 2.402
    GHz and stopping at 2.480 Hz. An internal software switch controls the bandwidth. The
    maximum frequency-hopping rate is 1,600 hops/sec.<br>
    The baseband describes the specifications of the digital signal processing part of the
    hardware&#151;the Bluetooth link controller, which carries out the baseband protocols and
    other low-level link routines.<br>
    A piconet is a group of two to eight devices connected via Bluetooth technology. Before
    any connections in a piconet are created, all devices are in standby mode. In this mode,
    an unconnected unit periodically listens for messages every 1.28 seconds. Each time a
    device wakes up, it listens on a set of 32 hop frequencies defined for that unit. The
    number of hop frequencies is 32 for most countries, except Japan, Spain, and France.<br>
    Any of the devices becomes the master by initiating the connection procedure. If the
    address is already known, connection is made by a &#145;page&#146; message. And if the
    address is unknown, connection is made by an &#145;inquiry&#146; message followed by a
    subsequent &#145;page&#146; message.<br>
    In the initial &#145;page&#146; state, the master unit will send a train of identical page
    messages on 16 different hop frequencies defined for the device to be paged (slave unit).
    If there is no response, the master transmits a train of messages on the remaining 16 hop
    frequencies in the wake-up sequence.<br>
    The maximum delay before the master reaches the slave is twice the wake-up period (2.56
    seconds) while the average delay is half the wake-up period (0.64 second).<br>
    The &#145;inquiry&#146; message is used for finding Bluetooth devices, including public
    printers; fax machines, and similar devices with an unknown address. This message is very
    similar to the &#145;page&#146; message, but may require one additional train period to
    collect all the responses. <br>
    A power-saving mode can be used for connected units in a piconet if no data needs to be
    transmitted. The master unit can put slave units into &#145;hold&#146; mode, where only an
    internal timer is running. Slave units can also demand to be put into &#145;hold&#146;
    mode. Data transfer restarts instantly when units transition out of &#145;hold&#146; mode.
    The &#145;hold&#146; mode is used when connecting several piconets or managing a low-power
    device such as a temperature sensor.<br>
    Two more low-power modes are available, the &#145;sniff&#146; mode and the
    &#145;park&#146; mode. In the &#145;sniff&#146; mode, a slave device listens to the
    piconet at reduced rate, thus reducing its duty cycle. The &#145;sniff&#146; interval is
    programmable and depends on the application. In the &#145;park&#146; mode, a device is
    still synchronized to the piconet but does not participate in the traffic.<br>
    The Bluetooth baseband technology supports two types of link, synchronous connection
    oriented (SCO) and asynchronous connectionless (ACL). The SCO link is used primarily for
    voice, and the ACL for packet data.<br>
    Different master-slave pairs of the same piconet can use different link types, and the
    link type may change arbitrarily during a session. Each link type supports up to sixteen
    different packet types. Four of these are control packets, common to both the SCO and ACL
    links. Both of these link types use a time division duplex (TDD) scheme for full-duplex
    transmissions.<br>
    The SCO link is symmetric and typically supports time-bound voice traffic. SCO packets are
    transmitted over reserved intervals. Once the connection is established, both master and
    slave units may send SCO packets without being polled. One SCO packet type allows both
    voice and data transmission&#151;with only the data portion being retransmitted when
    corrupted.<br>
    The ACL link is packet-oriented and supports both symmetric and asymmetric traffic. The
    master unit controls the link bandwidth and decides how much piconet bandwidth is given to
    each slave, and the symmetry of the traffic. Slaves must be polled before they can
    transmit data. The ACL link also supports broadcast messages from the master to all slaves
    in the piconet.<br>
    The three error-correction schemes defined for Bluetooth baseband controllers include 1/3
    rate forward error correction code (FEC), 2/3 rate forward error correction code (FEC),
    and automatic repeat request (ARQ) scheme for data.<br>
    FEC scheme reduces the number of retransmissions in the data payload. However, in a
    reasonably error-free environment, FEC creates unnecessary overhead that reduces the
    throughput. Since the packet header contains valuable link information and should survive
    bit errors, it is always protected by a 1/3 rate FEC. The recipient in the next slot
    directly acknowledges an unnumbered ARQ scheme is applied in which data transmitted in one
    slot. For a data transmission to be acknowledged, both the header error check and the
    cyclic redundancy check must be okay; otherwise a negative acknowledge is returned.<br>
    The Link Manager (LM) software carries out link setup, authentication, link configuration,
    and other protocols. It discovers other remote LMs and communicates with them via the Link
    Manager Protocol (LMP). To perform its service provider role, the LM uses the services of
    the Link Controller (LC). <br>
    The LM offers services such as sending and receiving of data, link address inquiries,
    connection set-up, and authentication. It has an efficient means to inquire and report a
    name or device ID up to 16 characters in length. It negotiates on link mode and set-up. It
    decides the actual frame type on a packet-by-packet basis.<br>
    In &#145;sniff&#146; mode, the duty cycle of the slave is reduced: it listens only M slots
    where M is negotiated at the LM. The master can only start transmission in specified time
    slots spaced at regular intervals. <br>
    In &#145;hold&#146; mode, turning off the receiver for longer periods saves power. Any
    device can wake up the link again, with an average latency of 4 seconds. This is defined
    by the LM and handled by the LC.<br>
    The LM sets a device in &#145;park&#146; mode when it does not need to participate on the
    channel and wants to stay synchronized. It wakes up at regular intervals to listen to the
    channel in order to resynchronize with the rest of the piconet, and to check for page
    messages.<br>
    Any device displaying the Bluetooth &#145;logo&#146; should interoperate with other
    Bluetooth devices. Software interoperability begins with the Bluetooth link level
    protocol, responsible for protocol multiplexing, device and service discovery, and
    segmentation and reassembly.<br>
    Bluetooth devices must be able to recognize each other and load the appropriate software
    to discover the higher level abilities each device supports. Interoperability at the
    application level requires identical protocol stacks. Different Bluetooth devices (PCs,
    handheld, headsets, cellular telephones) have different compliance requirements. To obtain
    more functionality, the Bluetooth software framework will reuse existing specifications
    such as OBEX, vCard/vCalendar, human interface device (HID), and TCP/IP.<br>
    Device compliance requires conformance to both the Bluetooth specification and existing
    protocols. The software framework is contemplating functions like configuration and
    diagnosis utility, device discovery, cable emulation, peripheral communication, audio
    communication and call control, object exchange for business cards and phone books, and
    networking protocol. <br>
    The Bluetooth specification contemplates interfaces where the radio modules may be
    integrated into notebook personal computers or attached using PC-card or USB.<br>
    Notebook PC usage models include remote networking using a Bluetooth cellular phone,
    speakerphone applications using a Bluetooth cellular phone, business card exchange between
    Bluetooth notebooks, handheld, and phones, and calendar synchronization between Bluetooth
    notebooks, handheld, and phones.<br>
    Bluetooth technology is operating system independent and not tied to any specific
    operating system. Implementations of the Bluetooth for several commercial operating
    systems are in development. For notebook computers, the implementation of the Bluetooth in
    Microsoft Windows 98 and NT 5.0 using WDM and NDIS drivers is being contemplated.
    Customer-visible interoperability is promoted by requiring minimal levels of software
    functionality, such as speakerphone, on notebook computers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

7.5pt;font-family:Verdana">Data exchange.
    Bluetooth&#146;s ability to penetrate solid objects and its capability for maximum
    mobility within the piconet allow for many data exchange applications. For example, with
    Bluetooth a person could synchronize his phone to a PC without taking the phone out of his
    pocket or purse. The omni directional capability of Bluetooth allows synchronization to
    start when the phone is brought into the range of the PC. This synchronization
    doesn&#146;t require the phone to be in a fixed location. LAN access. Because there are no
    line-of-sight requirements, Bluetooth is well suited to wirelessly connect a device to a
    wired network. Also, multipoint capability allows multiple devices to effectively share
    the media. Since Bluetooth&#146;s aggregate bandwidth is limited to 1 Mbps, the
    performance is not very encouraging. Dial-up networking. Emulating an EIA/TIA232
    connection between a portable computer and a mobile phone for establishing a dial-up
    connection to the Internet is also an application targeted by Bluetooth. The primary
    advantage of Bluetooth is that the user can leave the mobile phone clipped to his belt or
    in a pocket and walk around for the entire dial-up connection. Voice applications. A
    native feature of the Bluetooth specification is synchronous voice channels. Bluetooth has
    the ability to reserve bandwidth for carrying digital voice data. It can support as many
    as three simultaneous full-duplex voice conversations within a piconet. Security issues.
    Since Bluetooth is omni directional, a snooping device from any direction, including
    hidden locations, can monitor it. Bluetooth makes it possible to prevent eavesdropping on
    a conversation by providing authentication and encryption in its baseband protocol.
    Authentication relies on a challenge-response protocol utilizing a secret key (password).
    Both devices must contain the same secret key. The protocol allows each device to
    authenticate the other. After the devices are authenticated, it is possible to encrypt the
    transmission for added security. </span><span
