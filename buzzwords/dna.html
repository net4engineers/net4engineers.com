&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biometrics
relies on distinctive individual physiological traits. Within such traits, DNA (Deoxyribo
Nucleic Acid)&#151;the hereditary material that determines what genetic traits we
inherit&#151;is supposed to be the most distinctive. Structurally, it is a long
double-helical chain of a phosphate backbone, to which are attached ribose sugars and
nitrogenous bases. It is like a code that directs our body cells to make or assemble
things that are required for the functioning of our body.Though, within such a large
molecule, a first glance will not show up a significant difference in the
&#145;code&#146;, even a single insignificant change in the sequence leads to the
differences that we see. So much so for biology. </font></p>

A DNA molecule is divided into small functional units called genes, which determine your
black hair and brown eyes. DNA samples can be taken from the body if the subject or his
personal belongings are passed through chemical processes. This DNA fingerprint is in the
form of a sequence of A&#146;s, T&#146;s, G&#146;s and C&#146;s in random order. These
alphabets refer to the nitrogenous bases. There are lots of schemes that are followed for
generating&nbsp; algorithms. The most widely used is a kind of an indexed algorithm, which
is also probabilistic in nature. What this means is that these algorithms look for matches
only in those places where they are most likely to find a match and ignore the rest of the
database. From an existing database, the algorithm generates indices and then matches the
sequence under consideration, with them.&nbsp;</font></p>

The next step in DNA sequence matching is matching the shape of molecules. Biologists say
that much of what function a protein will do is also dependent on the shape it takes. But
researchers face another problem here. A protein molecule here can be in a variety of
similar but not same orientations. Hence researchers need to look at &#145;rigid
elements&#146; of molecules and the way the non-rigid elements are connected to them.
Molecules with similar rigid elements would then form a group. Algorithms then analyze and
match DNA sequences accordingly.DNA matching has advantages over other means of biometric
verification. DNA samples can be collected in many more forms than blood samples, retina
scans or fingerprints. Even the personal belongings of people like hairbrushes,
toothbrushes or clothes carry their DNA from phenomenon like natural skin flaking. So it
becomes close to impossible for an imposter to fake a DNA sample or avoid leaving a trace
at a crime scene. The only drawback is that DNA testing takes longer than other methods,
something like a couple of days to a week. </font></p>
