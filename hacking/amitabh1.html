    Manifesto&nbsp; by&nbsp; Amitabh Doctor</b></font></big></p>
    <p align="center"><strong><font face="Verdana">Who are the Hackers?&nbsp;</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>Computer hackers are now appearing on the
    front page of all major newspapers. Stories about computer intrusions are now commonplace
    in the newspapers, and are becoming increasingly popular in books and movies. The media
    portrays hackers as geniuses who can penetrate systems at will. While there are hackers
    who are geniuses, the majority of hackers do not fit into this category.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>Computer hackers are wreaking havoc on
    computer systems that contain private and sensitive information. It appears that no system
    is safe from these hackers, and that individuals are at their mercy. While the public
    might believe that it takes a genius to attain these accomplishments, what it really takes
    is very persistent people with sufficient time to learn their craft. Additionally, the
    ranks of hackers have grown to include Organized Crime, spies, and terrorist
    organizations. &nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="center"><small><strong><font face="Verdana">CATEGORIES OF HACKERS</font></strong></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>Most hackers seem to fit the stereotype of a
    teenage to college age male that has the perseverance to sit at a computer for hours at a
    time. These people usually have the financial freedom to wander through computer networks,
    because they are in environment (i.e., a college or their parents' home) that does not
    require them to work. Despite the stereotype being generally true, all hackers are not
    alike. By all accounts, most hackers do not intend to steal or cause any harm.
    Unfortunately for the benevolent hackers, any computer intruder is considered to be a
    hacker. The term &quot;hacker&quot; is used within the hacker community to refer to an
    individual that intrudes into computer systems to learn about computer systems. Hackers do
    not intend to profit from their efforts, nor do they intend to do any harm. This does not
    mean that hackers are immune from criminal actions. In most cases, any computer intrusion
    is a criminal offense. Additionally, many inexperienced hackers may inadvertently damage
    the computer systems that they access, and as will be discussed later, they may pass on
    information to criminals.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>&quot;Cracker&quot; is the term used for
    criminal hackers. These individuals do intend to use their hacker skills to profit from
    their efforts or to cause harm to individuals or organizations. Cracker ranks include
    petty criminals, loosely organized groups of criminals, major organized crime rings, the
    Russian Mafia, Drug Cartels, terrorists and foreign governments. These are the Information
    Warriors of the future. As the value of information and communications ability increases,
    these information warriors will become more active and pose one of the greatest threats to
    world prosperity and security.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>The term &quot;Phreaker&quot; is used to
    differentiate a computer hacker from an intruder that specializes in compromising the
    national and international telephone systems. The activities of &quot;phreakers&quot; may
    be criminal or benign. Phreakers have previously rerouted telephone lines, sold wiretaps,
    disconnected telephone lines, etc. They have performed these functions to elude police,
    steal telephone services, and for fun and profit. Many of the original hackers were
    phreakers, because the costs of communications services were too expensive to allow them
    to stay on computer systems across the nation for extended periods of time. Today, the
    Internet and other worldwide computer networks provide hackers with the cheap connectivity
    that they require. However, there are a significant number of phreakers that are still
    drawn to the challenge, and profit, that a successful attack on the telephone system can
    provide.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="center"><small><strong><font face="Verdana">HOW HACKERS LEARN THEIR CRAFT</font></strong></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>To non-computer professionals, hacker attacks
    seem to be very sophisticated, and require a very detailed knowledge of computer systems.
    However, most successful attacks rely upon brute force methods, such as attempting to
    access default accounts with default passwords. Unfortunately, the information required to
    attack a system is very readily available. If an attacker needs additional information,
    they can exploit the information they already have to attain additional information, or
    they may ask the targeted organization for the information.</small></font></p>
    <p align="center"><small><strong><font face="Verdana">Unethical Sources</font></strong></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>There are electronic hacker gathering places
    on the Internet, the X.25 networks, private computer systems, etc. At these gathering
    places, information is exchanged about what systems have recently been compromised, along
    with a cookbook for how the compromise occurred. An attacker interested in a specific
    target can ask others how to attack the target. These gathering places maintain databases,
    so that the information is available for future attackers.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Hackers bulletin boards generally provide system
    documentation that includes system level accounts and default passwords, known system
    vulnerabilities, and a variety of other information that facilitates an attack. Bulletin
    boards also have a variety of tools available that also facilitate an attack. The tools,
    such as SATAN, provide a user friendly method for even the most inept hackers to take
    advantage of known vulnerabilities. Different tools have different functionality. For
    example, there are some tools that look for known vulnerabilities in systems and other
    tools that attempt to obtain a user's password.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>While there are many people that contribute
    information to these gathering places, only a minority of these people intends to
    distribute the information for illegal purposes. There is a unique sense of morality among
    the hacker community. They believe that they are just searching for knowledge, which
    should be freely available to all. While they understand that some people may use the
    information for illegal purposes, they assume no responsibility for the results, but state
    that it is the victim's fault for letting it happen. In many cases, they might rationalize
    that the victim deserved to be attacked, because they treat their employees unfairly, they
    charge excessive prices, etc. To an outsider, it appears that majority of the hacker
    community has no sense of responsibility, and no understanding of the consequences of
    their actions.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="center"><small><strong><font face="Verdana">Legitimate Sources</font></strong></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>There is also extensive information about
    system vulnerabilities from a wide variety of legitimate sources. The Computer Emergency
    Response Team (CERT), out of the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Melon
    University, regularly informs people about security vulnerabilities, as well as the fixes,
    of specific system types. This information is distributed to protect systems throughout
    the world, unfortunately the hackers are more familiar with the information than the
    intended recipients. Many manufacturers publish similar information, however the hacker
    community is also well informed of this information and attempts to exploit the
    information before system administrators fix the problem. There are a wide variety of
    publications for computer professionals that also report vulnerabilities and how to
    exploit them. The primary problem associated with the legitimate reporting of system
    vulnerabilities is that the information reaches the attackers more efficiently than it
    reaches the intended audience.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>There are many other sources of information
    that can be used to exploit a target. Newspapers reporting specifics about a potential
    target can provide a wealth of information about their computer systems, corporate
    strategies, corporate executives, etc. For example, Information Week, a magazine for
    computer professionals, regularly details the Information Technology strategy of large
    organizations as a feature for its' readers. While seemingly insignificant, the articles
    identify the types of computer systems used, communications protocols, customer
    organizations, etc. There are a wide variety of information services available on the
    Internet that can provide an attacker with similar information. Traditionally, this type
    of information is referred to as Open Source Information (OSI).&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="center"><small><strong><font face="Verdana">The Target as a Source</font></strong></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>When an attacker faces technical challenges
    that cannot be quickly overcome, they might contact the target to ask them for
    information. Public organizations will freely distribute their Annual Report, which could
    provide a wealth of information about corporate structure, senior executives, and
    information technology strategies.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>The attacker may also utilize Social
    Engineering, which is the use of non-technical methods to obtain information. For example,
    an attacker may randomly telephone employees of a company, and through a variety of ruses,
    gets an employee to give the attackers their passwords. While this may sound ridiculous,
    previous studies by the author have indicated that over 90% of employees contacted will
    divulge this information. Having the log in information for a valid account will render
    millions of dollars of information security technology useless. &nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>Social Engineering can take on many forms.
    Attackers have resorted to methods that border on the ridiculous as well as espionage. In
    many cases, attackers have gone through the garbage of a targeted organization to obtain
    any information that they can. It was going through the garbage at the New York Telephone
    Company that provided phreakers with system level passwords for the national telephone
    system. This information allowed the phreakers to totally compromise the telephone
    systems. The magazine 2600: The Hackers' Quarterly, which is a publication targeting
    computer hackers, recently published an article on how to obtain a job as a janitor in a
    targeted organization. There have been many cases where attackers have obtained jobs as
    janitors, security guards, programmers, etc., so that they may obtain insider information
    on how to break into computer systems. The payback is exceptionally high if the intention
    is theft of funds. Many people would not think twice about taking a job as a janitor for
    minimum wage, if they could steal millions of dollars several months later. Besides of
    funds, attackers have acquired a variety of sensitive company data that can cripple a
    company. The sensitive data could include customer lists, employee information, executive
    travel plans, strategic marketing plans, etc. This is information is given out by
    employees attempting to be helpful to someone that apparently has a need for the
    information. Poor security procedures allow Social Engineering attacks to flourish.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>Due to the potential profit of a successful
    computer intrusion, it is very possible that an attacker may resort to physical break ins
    to obtain information. Lapses in physical security can provide attackers with a unique
    opportunity to obtain information. Additionally, attackers may attempt to recruit current
    employees of an organization to assist in computer related thefts. Many companies have
    offices throughout the world, in many areas that do not think well of foreign
    corporations. Additionally, an attacker will offer a potential recruit much more money
    than they will ever make under the employ of the company. Financial incentive, coupled
    with a poor loyalty to the employer leaves many people susceptible to recruitment. It must
    also be considered that attackers have compromised credit-reporting agencies. Attackers
    are able to select the recruits that are having financial difficulties, and who are more
    likely to welcome a new income opportunity.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>There are thousands of sensitive documents
    throughout all organizations. Unless these documents are securely controlled 24 hours a
    day, and are properly destroyed, it is very likely that some of the documents will fall
    into the hands of attackers.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>After a hacker has achieved an initial
    foothold inside the target's computer systems, an attacker may use tools that are commonly
    available from other attackers to obtain more information from the systems. For example,
    initial attacks into a company's computer system may provide hackers a small but
    insignificant foothold on the systems. The hackers can then install a sniffer that allows
    them to monitor system users' keystrokes. It is likely that the information learned from
    the sniffer will allow the hackers virtually unlimited access to the computer systems
    compromised.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="center"><small><strong><font face="Verdana">HACKER MORALITY</font></strong></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>As previously discussed, hackers do not
    believe that their computer intrusions are wrong. Even a U.S. Senator, Patrick Leahy,
    implied that hackers should be allowed to explore so that they may learn. To understand
    these beliefs, you must understand how people learn what is right and what is wrong.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>Usually people learn what is right and wrong
    from their parents. They are told not to steal and not to do drugs. Parents usually do not
    tell their children that it is wrong to break into NORAD computer systems and start a
    nuclear war, nor do parents tell their children that breaking into a computer system is as
    bad as breaking into someone's home. Parents do not consider talking to their children
    about these things, because they never thought their children could do these things.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>This leaves morality to be learned on the
    streets, or in this case, cyberspace. Hackers learn morality from other hackers, who learn
    it from other hackers. A morality of this type only perpetuates the morals that best suit
    the participants. It would be as difficult to convince a hacker that computer intrusions
    are wrong, as it would be to convince a minister that his/her religion is wrong.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>From an outsider's viewpoint, it appears that
    a traditional hacker's fundamental beliefs include: &nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>hackers have a right to &quot;explore&quot;
    all computer systems that they can compromise, &nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>hackers have a right to attempt to compromise
    any computer system, &nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>Anyone that would try to prevent them from
    breaking into computer systems is compromising their First Amendment rights, hackers
    should share information about computer intrusions with anyone except people that would
    try to stop the intrusions, and </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>hackers should not steal nor cause harm.
    &nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>Unfortunately, there are other groups of
    hackers that would also contend: hackers must take revenge on anyone that would try to
    stop them, it is acceptable to steal or cause harm if the victim has done something that
    they believe to be wrong, and it is acceptable to steal if the theft supports a hacker's
    ability to hack. &nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>While traditional hackers would frown upon
    these opinions, they will not take actions against anyone performing malicious actions.
    This implies that hackers are not self-policing, which harms the image of the majority of
    hackers and has created an outcry from the general public that something must be done to
    crackdown on all hackers. &nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>It is extremely difficult to distinguish a
    well-meaning hacker from a malicious one. Unfortunately, they both present a danger to any
    computer system. If a non-malicious hacker successfully compromises a computer system,
    hacker protocol and pride dictates that they must tell another hacker how they
    accomplished the intrusion. The information generally proliferates throughout the hacker
    community, and eventually falls into the wrong hands. Many hackers say that they are
    necessary in cyberspace, because they help to identify vulnerabilities. However, there
    have not been any documented cases of a hacker contacting a Systems Administrator to tell
    the administrator how they compromised the system.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="center"><small><strong><font face="Verdana">THE FUTURE INFORMATION WARRIORS</font></strong></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>The traditional criminal elements are now
    beginning to realize and exploit the potential financial and political gain associated
    with computer crimes. Criminal organizations are hiring many experienced hackers to attack
    very well capitalized commercial firms. In many cases, they enlist the help of naive
    hackers to help them obtain information the electronic exchange of information allows
    anonymity for the criminal elements, and the ill-informed hackers are duped into providing
    information to criminals.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>Hacker knowledge may not just come from the
    traditional hackers. The collapse of the Soviet Union has left many extremely talented
    computer and communications professionals out of work and penniless. When the former
    Soviet Union collapsed, the funding for many technology-based programs was lost. Hard
    working, well meaning people were without jobs, and were forced to take jobs outside of
    their trained professions. These people are very easily recruited by Organized Crime and
    terrorist elements. In many cases, they are facing the same traditional enemy, except now
    they are being paid better. These people represent a tremendous threat, because now their
    missions are not as focused and they work for less disciplined employers with potentially
    erratic motives.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>Intelligence agents from the former Soviet
    Block are also going to new employers. These people are extremely well trained in
    electronic intrusion techniques, and can be expected to find new jobs working for criminal
    organizations or foreign governments. Former Soviet agents have advertised their services
    in a variety of publications throughout Europe.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>Even friendly governments have acknowledged
    and established efforts that target U.S. based computer systems to gather economic
    intelligence. Countries that have acknowledged support for hacker efforts include Germany,
    France and Japan. These countries clearly target U.S. corporations and probably target the
    U.S. Government. Economic losses to U.S. corporations are estimated to be in excess of
    $1,000,000,000 annually.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="center"><small><strong><font face="Verdana">CONCLUSIONS</font></strong></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>The hacker community is a very diverse group
    that shares a common interest in exploring computer systems throughout the world. These
    people also share the knowledge of where to go to give and get information on vulnerable
    computer systems. It is this information that presents what could be considered the most
    ominous emerging threat to U.S. security and prosperity. The information is available to
    anyone in cyberspace that is believed to be a real hacker. &nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><small>It is the indiscriminate exchange of
    information that is cause for concern. The information is available not only to
    non-malicious hackers, but to all types of criminals and foreign governments. While the
    criminal elements provide an obviously direct threat to computer systems, it is the
    non-malicious hackers that are usually the most aggressively pursued. The criminals tend
    to attack known vulnerabilities, while the non-malicious intruders desire the challenge of
    finding new vulnerabilities. The new vulnerabilities tend to be readily shared with the
    hacker community as a whole. The non-malicious intruders find the keys that are used by
    the criminals to open the doors. Until the indiscriminate exchange of information is
    halted, all intrusion attempts represent a possible criminal action that must be handled
    appropriately.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><small>The traditional hackers, who represent the first generation
    of Information Warriors, are now being joined by a new group of people that are actually
    interested in Information Warfare. Organized Crime is realizing that not only can they
    profit from criminal cyber activities, the can extort money and retaliate against their
    enemies using Information Warfare. Terrorists are learning that destroying information
    targets can be more devastating than destroying physical targets. Foreign companies know
    that acquiring specific information can give them a tremendous competitive advantage.
    National governments are researching how they can cripple an enemy through Information
    Warfare alone. The traditional hackers have identified and scouted out a new battlefield,
    and the implications of their activities have become enormous.</small></font></p>
