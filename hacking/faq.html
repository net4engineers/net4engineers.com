size="2" face="Courier New">Frequently asked questions about hacking</font></b></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Well, I finally got so bored that I decided to write
this...no, I&#146;m only joking...I wrote this because I know how frustrating it is to
want information badly. Everyone knows about hacking, and whether people agree, or
disagree with it...they all know deep down that if they ever got access to a comp that
they weren't meant to - it would feel great.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I know this is difficult to understand, but there are
reasons why elite hackers don't just write endless text files on how to hack every single
electronic thing that beeps. The main reason being that they know people like us are going
to read them and go &quot;Oh, so that&#146;s what I do!&quot;. Then they go out and do it
along with the 1000,000,000 people that read the text file, and eventually that exploit
dries up because everyone in the world knows about it. And lets be honest, its only fun
when it feels like your the only one who has been successful at hacking the specific comp.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I would like to get this out of the way, I am not a
computer expert, I am not 'elite', I am not a Haxor - I just love learning about
computers. I literally bow down to those people that really are the elite of the computer
world. I am writing this file because I want to share the small knowledge of things that I
do know about with you. If you want to become a hacker just to impress your friends then
don't bother. If you want to impress your friends, just get a shell account somewhere and
tap in a few info finding commands such as finger, whois, who etc. Trust me, they wont
even want to understand what your doing - they just think &quot;hmm, he must be
good!&quot;. More on shells later though.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The amount of wannabe hackers has literally trebled since
the Internet became popular. Now wannabes all round the world can go to some search engine
and type in &quot;Hacking&quot; and get more information than they can take in. This has a
plus side though, it means those who are truly elite will be worshiped even more, and it
means that companies will have to start thinking harder about security (which can't be
bad...can it?).</font></p>

begin?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Well, most text files would probably disagree with this,
but I think Windows 9x is as good as any other OS for getting started. Most people will
tell you to go away and not come back until you have Unix or Linux, but that&#146;s really
flinging you in at the deep end. In this file I will focus mostly on Windows 95 but I will
mention Unix a bit later on.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Here&#146;s what you will probably need:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">An OS (Operating system, could be DOS (?), Windows, Unix,
    Linux, BeOS etc.)</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">A lot of text files (This is a good start)</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">A selection of good web sites</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">A web browser (I use Netscape, but IE is as good as any)</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">An IRC client (IRC = Internet relay chat...well, this isn't
    really essential - but its a laugh!)</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Telnet (or similar)</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Small knowledge of programming in some language</font></li>

<p><a name="language"></a><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Arial"><b>What programming
languages should I learn?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Some good languages to look at are:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">C (or C++)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Perl</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Personally, I started off just having a peak at QBasic,
then I moved on to VB and Pascal, then Delphi, and finally Perl and C. That&#146;s
probably not the best order to learn them in, but its really what suits you.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I use:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Borland C++ Builder 5<br>

<p><a name="telnet"></a><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Arial"><b>What is Telnet?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Telnet is a program that allows you to connect to other
computers using ports. Every computer/server has ports, the most common ones you would see
when using telnet are:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Port 21: FTP</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Port 23: Telnet</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Port 25: SMTP (Mail)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Port 37: Time</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Port 43: Whois</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">So, for example you could tell Telnet to connect to
mail.virgin.net on port 25. This would connect you to Virgins mail server.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Telnet really is essential, and its a great information
tool as well.</font></p>

<p><a name="ip"></a><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Arial"><b>What is an IP address?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">An IP address is a unique number which is given to you when
you use your modem to connect to the internet. No two people can have the same IP address
at one time, and your IP address changes every time you connect. An IP address looks like
this: 198.164.32.123 Usually, the first 6 numbers will be the same every time you connect
because they tell us what Internet service provider you are using (For example, 198.164 is
the standard beginning for a Virgin.net IP address). The last 5 numbers are unique to you.
Believe it or not, people can find out absolutely tons of stuff about you just from seeing
your IP address. You also probably don't realise that your IP address is logged
practically every time you do anything on the net. This happens so that if you do
something you shouldn't be (being an evil Haxor for instance!) the people who logged your
IP can contact your Internet service provider and get you thrown off the net. The other
bad thing about IP addresses, is the misuse that people can do with them. If someone on
IRC gets hold off your IP address (that&#146;s easy by the way, there is a command /dns
which gives them anyones IP) they can type it into a nuke program and crash your
connection or even your computer. Recently, IP addresses have also been used in a lot of
trojan programs such as Back Oriface and Netbus. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><a name="findip"></a><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Arial"><b>How do I find out
my IP address?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In windows, go to the start menu and choose run, then type
in &quot;Winipcfg&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In mIRC, connect to a server then type /dns &lt;your
nick&gt; (that should work unless they have an IP cloacking device)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In Unix, if you use unix then you should already know how
to get your own IP!</font></p>

<hr>

<p><a name="ipspoof"></a><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Arial"><b>What is IP
Spoofing?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This is the art of hiding your real IP address, and making
it look like you have a different one. Please see &quot;What are Wingates?&quot; for a few
examples.</font></p>

<p><a name="whatistrojan"></a><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Arial"><b>What is a
trojan/worm/virus/logic bomb?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This is excerpted from: Computer Security Basics by Deborah
Russell and G.T. Gengemi Sr.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Trojan</i>: An independent program that appears to
perform a useful function but that hides another unauthorized program inside it. When an
authorized user performs the apparrent function, the trojan horse performs the
unauthorized function as well (often usurping the priveleges of the user).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Virus</i>: A code fragment (not an independent program)
that reproduces by attaching to another program. It may damage data directly, or it may
degrade system performance by taking over system resources which are then not available to
authorized users.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Worm</i>: An independent program that reproduces by
copying itself from one system to another, usually over a network. Like a virus, a worm
may damage data directly, or it may degrade system performace by tying up system resources
and even shutting down a network.</font></p>

<p><a name="pgp"></a><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Arial"><b>What is PGP?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This is excerpted from: PGP(tm) User's Guide Volume I:
Essential Topics by Philip Zimmermann</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">PGP(tm) uses public-key encryption to protect E-mail and
data files. Communicate securely with people you've never met, with no secure channels
needed for prior exchange of keys. PGP is well featured and fast, with sophisticated key
management, digital signatures, data compression, and good ergonomic design.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Pretty Good(tm) Privacy (PGP), from Phil's Pretty Good
Software, is a high security cryptographic software application for MSDOS, Unix, VAX/VMS,
and other computers. PGP allows people to exchange files or messages with privacy,
authentication, and convenience. Privacy means that only those intended to receive a
message can read it. Authentication means that messages that appear to be from a
particular person can only have originated from that person. Convenience means that
privacy and authentication are provided without the hassles of managing keys associated
with conventional cryptographic software. No secure channels are needed to exchange keys
between users, which makes PGP much easier to use. This is because PGP is based on a
powerful new technology called &quot;public key&quot; cryptography.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">PGP combines the convenience of the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman
(RSA) public key cryptosystem with the speed of conventional cryptography, message digests
for digital signatures, data compression before encryption, good ergonomic design, and
sophisticated key management. And PGP performs the public-key functions faster than most
other software implementations. PGP is public key cryptography for the masses.</font></p>

<p><a name="unix"></a><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Arial"><b>What is Unix?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Unix is an Operating system (just like Windows is an
operating system), it is the most powerful, hacker-friendly operating system available.
UNIX happens to be a multi-user-multi-tasking system, thus bringing a need for security
not found on MSDOS, Windows etc. It uses the programing language C.</font></p>

<p><a name="telnetunix"></a><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Arial"><b>How do I know
if I telnet to a Unix system?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ok, let me tell you how a unix system might greet you if
you connected to it. First, when you call up a UNIX, or connect to one however you do, you
will usually get this prompt:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">login:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">*Note: If you get the prompt &quot;Logon:&quot; it probably
ISN'T Unix.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">That means that this is PROBABLY a Unix system, Some Unix
systems will tell you what they are or give you a message before a</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">login: prompt, as such:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Welcome to SHUnix. Please log in.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">login:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Or something like that. Ok, we are at the login prompt, now
you need to enter in a valid account. An Account usually consists of 8 characters</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">or less. After you enter in an account, you will probably
get a password prompt of some sort. The prompts may vary, as the source code to the login
program is usually supplied with UNIX, or is readily available for free.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Well, The easiest thing I can say to do to login is
basically this:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Get an account, or try the defaults. The defaults are ones
that came with the operating system, in standard form. The list of some of the Defaults
are as follows:</font></p>

<p><a name="shell"></a><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Arial"><b>What is a shell
account?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Taken from Happy Hackers GTMHH beginners series #1</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A shell account allows you to use your home computer as a
terminal on which you can give commands to a computer running Unix. The &quot;shell&quot;
is the program that translates your keystrokes into Unix commands. With the right shell
account you can enjoy the use of a far more powerful workstation than you could ever dream
of affording to own yourself. It also is a great stepping stone to the day when you will
be running some form of Unix on your home computer.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><a name="whereshell"></a><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Arial"><b>Where can I get
a shell account?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Well, you can buy them from places (try doing a search on
the internet) or you may even be able to get one free! Try <a
href="http://www.freeshell.com">www.freeshell.com</a> or doing a search for 'Free Shell'.
In my experience, its best to pay for a shell - that way you wont have any restrictions
etc. All of the free shells I have seen disable the 'Telnet' command until you start
paying for the shell.</font></p>

<p><a name="crackpasswd"></a><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Arial"><b>How can I
crack Unix account passwords?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Well, the best bet is to try to get an account on the
system (like your free shell account!) or try to log in as a visitor or a guest. You can
then get the password file, which is stored in standard Unix systems as:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">/etc/passwd.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Each line in a passwd file is a different account, here is
what a line will mean:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">userid:password:userid#:groupid#:GECOS field:home dir:shell</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Each section of the line is seperated by a &quot;:&quot;,
here are the sections:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">userid = the userid name, entered at login and can be a
name or a number.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">password = the password is written here in encrypted form.
The encryption is one way only. When a login occurs the password entered is run thru the
encryption algorithm (along with a salt) and then contrasted to the version in the passwd
file that exists for the login name entered. If they match, then the login is allowed. If
not, the password is declared invalid.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">userid# = a unique number assigned to each user, used for
permissions</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">groupid# = similar to userid#, but controls the group the
user belongs to. To see the names of various groups check /etc/group</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">GECOS FIELD = this field is where information about the
user is stored. Usually in the format full name, office number, phone number, home phone.
Also a good source of info to try and crack a password.</font></p>

automatically started for the login</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">So, seems quite straight foward, get the passwd file, get
the encrypted text in the password field, and then run it through a cracker (by the way,
get a program called &quot;CrackerJack&quot; for this - or &quot;John the Ripper&quot;)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Seems a little simple doesn't it? Wrong! Very rarely will
you ever find a password file with the password field like that. Onto the next section:</font></p>

shadowed password?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A shadowed password is when, in a unix passwd file, instead
of the encrypted password being shown in the password field, a single character will be
shown (usually an X or a *). This tells the comp that the password file is actually stored
somewhere else, probably where normal users cant go. You may be able to find the
Unshadowed backup file though:</font></p>

backup is available from the &quot;Hack FAQ&quot; written by Voyager.]</font></p>

to it save it and crack it.</font></p>
